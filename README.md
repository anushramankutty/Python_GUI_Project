- Delete a student's record based on their register number.
- View a student's details by entering their register number.
- Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter.

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- PIL (Pillow)
- MySQL Connector for Python
- MySQL Server

     ```python
     mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
         host="your_host",
         user="your_username",
         password="your_password",
         database="reglist"
     )
     ```

## Usage

   - Execute the Python script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

2. **Interact with the GUI**
   - Enter the student's register number, name, department year, amount, and current status.
